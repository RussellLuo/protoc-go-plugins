# protoc-go-plugins

Some useful Go's protoc plugins.


## Prerequisites

- gRPC
- Protocol Buffers v3
- the protoc plugin for Go

See [gRPC Go Quickstart][1] for installation instructions.


## Plugins

### protoc-gen-gohttp

Expose your gPRC services as HTTP services.

#### Installation

Install protoc-gen-gohttp:

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/RussellLuo/protoc-go-plugins/protoc-gen-gohttp
```

#### Usage

Generate HTTP services for all gRPC services defined in the proto file:

```bash
$ protoc <proto file> --gohttp_out=pb_pkg_path=<pb pacakge path>:<output path>
```

As you can see, `pb_pkg_path` is the path of the pb package, which is generated by `protoc-gen-go`.


#### Examples

See [examples](examples) to find out how to expose a simple gRPC service as an HTTP service.
